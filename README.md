# demo-newrelic-instrumentation

This repository is intended to be used by the [demo-deployer](https://github.com/newrelic/demo-deployer).

## Supported NewRelic versions
### On-Host/Infrastructure

#### New Relic
All the current and documented releases on this page are supported
https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/release-notes/infrastructure-release-notes/infrastructure-agent-release-notes

### demo-deployer

#### User configuration

The schema below defines the possible configuration options for newrelic:

```json
{
    "newrelic": {
      "licenseKey": "YOUR_NR_LICENSE_KEY",
      "insightsInsertApiKey": "NR_INSIGHTS_INSERT_API_KEY",
      "accountId": "ACCOUNT_ID",
      "accountRootId": "ROOT ACOUNT_ID",
      "urls":{
        "collector": "NR_COLLECTOR_URL",
        "api": "NR_API_URL",
        "infraCollector": "NR_INFRA_COLLECTOR_URL",
        "infraCommand": "NR_INFRA_COMMAND_URL",
        "identity": "NR_IDENTITY_URL",
        "logging": "NR_LOGGING_URL",
        "cloudCollector": "NR_CLOUD_COLLECTOR_URL"
      }
    }
}
```

Note, all URLs are optional by default.


Typically, language agents only need the collector URL.
The Infra agent needs the following URLs: infraCollector, infraCommand and identity.
The Logging product needs the logging URL.


#### Deploy configuration 'deploy_script_path'
To instrument a Linux host use this path for the deploy script path

      "deploy_script_path": "deploy/linux/roles"

### NodeJS

#### New Relic
All the current and documented releases on this page are supported
https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/nodejs-release-notes/

#### demo-deployer 'deploy_script_path'
To instrument a NodeJS service use this path for the deploy script path

      "deploy_script_path": "deploy/node/linux/roles"

Here is an instrumentor configuration example:
```
 {
      "id": "nr_node_agent",
      "service_ids": ["simulator"],
      "provider": "newrelic",
      "source_repository": "-b main https://github.com/newrelic/demo-newrelic-instrumentation.git",
      "deploy_script_path": "deploy/node/linux/roles",
      "version": "6.2.0"
},
```

Please note, the application should have html files in the /public folder. The instrumentation will deploy them as html template in a /views folder and use EJS to dynamically inject the NewRelic agent.

The node instrumentation would also install the newrelic winston plugin. However, the application should declare a unique winston logger with the syntax below:

```javascript
const logger = winston.createLogger()
```


### Java

#### New Relic
All the current and documented releases on this page are supported
https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/java-release-notes

#### demo-deployer 'deploy_script_path'

##### Ansible pre-requesite

In order to deploy newrelic instrumentation for java, the following ansible plugin should be installed on the host running the deployer before hand ```ansible-galaxy install newrelic.newrelic_java_agent```

##### deploy_script_path'
To instrument a Java service hosted on Tomcat, use this path for the deploy script path

      "deploy_script_path": "deploy/java/linux/tomcat/roles"

### Python

#### New Relic
All the current and documented releases on this page are supported
https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/release-notes/agent-release-notes/python-release-notes

#### demo-deployer 'deploy_script_path'
To instrument a Python service use this path for the deploy script path

      "deploy_script_path": "deploy/python/linux/roles"

### Logging
The below play is meant to be use with the installation of the Fluentd application as a service in the https://github.com/newrelic/demo-deployer.
Then add a service instrumentation with the below script path to ensure the logs are sent to NR.
Please see the [demo-deployer](https://github.com/newrelic/demo-deployer) documentation for the setup of the NR api keys.

        "deploy_script_path": "deploy/logging/roles"

#### Logging in Context
Similar to logging, there is also another specific play for instrumenting with Logging in Context.

        "deploy_script_path": "deploy/logging_in_context/roles"

This instrumentation is dependent on the application to generate a log file in its directory named `application.log.json`
For example if a service was being deployed with the demo-deployer with an id of "node1" on an AWS EC2 instance, the log file should be in the path /home/ec2-user/node1/application.log.json

### Alerts

Alerts can be created in newrelic through the use of the Terraform provider.
Here is an example of demo [demo-deployer](https://github.com/newrelic/demo-deployer) configuration.
This alert deployment creates an alert for a service `node1` with the 4 golden signals: Low Throughput, High Response Time, High CPU usage, High Error Percentage.

```json
      {
        "id": "nr_alert_service",
        "service_ids": ["node1"],
        "provider": "newrelic",
        "provider_credential": "aws",
        "source_repository": "https://github.com/newrelic/demo-newrelic-instrumentation.git",
        "deploy_script_path": "deploy/alerts/terraform/roles",
        "params": {
          "s3_bucketname_tfstate": "terraform-alerts",
          "alert_duration": 5,
          "alert_response_time_threshold": 5,
          "alert_throughput_threshold": 10,
          "alert_error_percentage_threshold": 10,
          "alert_cpu_threshold": 80
        }
```
